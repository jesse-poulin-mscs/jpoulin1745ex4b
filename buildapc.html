            <p>
                The first step towards building a pc is to select what parts you want to build it with.<br />
                <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/">PCPartPicker</a> is a great place to start/plan out a system build.<br />
                The bare minimum each PC needs in order to function is to have Motherboard, RAM, CPU, CPU cooler, GPU, PSU, case, and a hard drive or ssd.
                To read about the definitions and functions of each of those go to Definitions.<br />
                Once you understand the terms and functions you'll need to start obtaining everything you need for a PC.
                <br />
                In general, to have a fully functional PC, you'll need a GPU, CPU, PSU, some RAM, storage, a case and a motherboard.

                    <h3>Central Processing Unit, Motherboard and Case</h3>
                    <p>
                        Be careful when choosing a cpu, as you have to get a corresponding motherboard to go with it.
                        When choosing a motherboard, besides the cpu slot, you should look at form factor of the case you're going to use. There are three sizes you could get for both motherboard and case. They are ATX, mATX AND ITX. ATX is the biggest you'll find while mATX is the second smallest with ITX being the smallest. So what should you focus your eyes on? ATX should be used to if you want plenty of USB ports and extra space for the graphics card. mATX and ITX should be used when you want something small and more portable. However, when choosing mATX or ITX make sure you choose a graphics card that fits. Above all, you should choose something that has good enough airflow. Without good airflow, your components age faster due to excess heat that isn't handled correctly.<br />
                        As far as choice of CPUs go you have a choice of either Intel or AMD. Both provide fierce competition to one another, so there's no going wrong with either.

                <div id="storage" class="container tab-pane fade">
                    <br>
                    <h3>Storage</h3>
                    <p>
                        When it comes to storage you have several options. Those are SSDs, HDDs, SSHDs and NVMe m.2 drives. As far as interfaces go, SSDs, HDDs and SSHDs all use SATA, while the relatively new NVMe m.2 uses PCIe as an interface. The fastest you can get today is an NVMe drive at relatively 5 times or greater the read/write of an SSD. An SSD itself handily beats both HDDs and SSHDs.
                        <br />
                        In terms of price, an SSD is going to cost the same as PCIe gen 3 NVMe drive, while being twice as expensive compared to similar GB amount HDDs and SSHDs.
                        An NVMe drive will also follow PCIe interface versions with PCIe gen 4 becoming the norm and PCIe 5 following close behind. However, even though an NVMe is theoretically faster than an SSD, it is barely reflected in computers today, with NVMe drives performing only slighty faster on the user end.
                        <br />
                        Something to also note is that with the rollout of PCIe gen 4, which by the way is two times the theoretical performance of gen 3, is the price difference. PCIe gen 4 drives are currently twice as expensive as gen 3 drives with similar GB amounts. This is mainly due to lack of competition on the storage controller front. With that out of the way, when should you choose a SSHD or HDD? When you want reliable long term storage of data.

                    <h3>Random Access Memory</h3>
                    <p>
                        In choosing ram, you should choose the version of ddr that corresponds with your motherboard. Right now the norm is ddr4 with motherboards from both intel and amd with ddr5 becoming a reality around the same time PCIe gen 5 will come out. Along with version you should choose the ram with speed supported by the CPU. The speed will be something measuring in mhz, like 3200mhz for example. For the amount of ram, it's recommended to have atleast 8gb with a non gaming office focused computer and atleast 16gb and up with a gaming computer.

                    <h3>Graphics Processing Unit</h3>
                    <p>
                        When choosing a graphics card (GPU), you should be aware of PCIe versioning, as even though it doesn't make much difference now it could make a big difference in the future. Your choice of graphics should reflect your gaming use case. If your gaming at 1080p your good to go with 6gb and 4gb vram options but with 1440p and 4k you're going to want 8gb and up of vram.

                    <h3>Power Supply</h3>
                    <p>
                        When choosing a power supply you should choose according to your how many watts your computer components are going to require.
                        <br />
                        As a rule the GPU is the component that's going to take the most wattage, with the the CPU in a distant second. Generally you'll want a minimum 500 wattage PSU with a dedicated graphics card with lesser amounts being fine for computers without dedicated graphics.

                        After you've gotten all your components and fitted them together, you're going to want to benchmark your PC to see relative performace of your components.
